         <br/>
         We will start with the training phase in which you will see arrangements of blocks.<br/>
         Your task will be to select all blocks that you think will fall (multiple selections possible!).
        <br/>
         After you have made your choice, click on RUN to see which blocks actually fall.

         By clicking on CONTINUE you'll proceed with the next training trial.

    You will be shown two pictures of the same scenes of block arrangements as in the training phase.

    This time, you will read a dialogue between Ann and Bob talking about any such scene. Note that this scene is not necessarily one of the two pictures that you see.

    First, click on the upper button to see Ann's question, then click on the button below to see Bob's answer.
    <br />
    <br />
    After you read the dialogue, you will be able to select a picture by clicking on it.
    We ask you to select the picture that you think Bob is more likely to see given his answer to Ann's question.

    <br/>
    By clicking on CONTINUE you'll proceed with the next trial.
