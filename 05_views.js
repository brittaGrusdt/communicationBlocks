         Your task will be to select all blocks that you think will fall (multiple selections possible!).

  title: "Instructions Testing Phase",
  text: `Great -  we'll now proceed with the test phase of the experiment.<br/><br/>
  You will play a simple 3-player game with Ann and Bob in which you have to work together as a team.
  This is an example of how the game may look like for each of you:

  <br/>
    <img src="./stimuli/img/screens-instruction/separate-ann-bob.png" style="max-width:90%">
    <img src="./stimuli/img/screens-instruction/separate-you.png" style="max-width:90%">
  <br/><br/>

  Ann's, Bob's and your joint goal is to make as many points as possible.
  During the game, only a minimal amount of interaction is allowed: <br/><br/>

  <b>1.</b> Ann, who does not have any experience with these scenes of block arrangements, sees part of the scene that Bob sees,
  but she can ask Bob a question about it.<br/><br/>

  <b>2.</b> Bob, who is an expert concerning these scenes of block arrangements, can only reply to Ann's question to inform <i>you</i> about the scene that he sees.<br/><br/>

  <b>3.</b> You will see the partial scene that Ann sees, the question she asked and Bob's response.
  Based on this information, your task will be to decide which of three shown scenes is the one that Bob sees.<br/><br/>

  You may select <b>one or more</b> of the three scenes shown to you.
  Depending on your choice, Ann, Bob and you will get or lose points.<br/><br/>

  To demonstrate this, we use the example from above again:
  <br/><br/>
    <img src="./stimuli/img/screens-instruction/anns-bobs-screen.jpeg" style="max-width:90%">
  <br/><br/>

  <u>This is what they say</u>:<br/>
  <b>Ann</b>: Which blocks do you think will fall?<br/>
  <b>Bob</b>: The BLUE and the GREEN block will fall.<br/><br/>
  <b>Note: Please read both, Ann's question and Bob's answer, carefully!</b><br/><br/>


  If you are confident and select a single scene, and your choice is correct,<br/>
  you will <b>get 100 points</b>:.
  <br/>
  <img src="./stimuli/img/screens-instruction/select1-true.png" style="max-width:90%">
  <br/><br/>
  However, if you select a single scene and your choice is wrong,<br/>
  you will <b>lose 100 points</b>:<br/>
  <img src="./stimuli/img/screens-instruction/select1-false.png" style="max-width:90%">
  <br/><br/>
  But if you select two scenes, including the correct one, you will <b>win 50 points</b>:<br/>
  <img src="./stimuli/img/screens-instruction/select2.png" style="max-width:90%">
  <br/><br/>

  Therefore, in order to avoid loosing points, it will be better for you to select two scenes when you are undecided.<br/>

  Even though this is unlikely to happen, note that you will also <b>lose 100 points</b> if:<br/>
  1. you select two scenes, <i>not</i> including the correct one OR if<br/>
  2. you select all three scenes.<br/><br/>`,
