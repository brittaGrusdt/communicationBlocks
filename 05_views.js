         <br/>
         We will start with the training phase in which you will see arrangements of blocks.<br/>
         Your task will be to select all blocks that you think will fall (multiple selections possible!).

         After you have made your choice, click on RUN to see which blocks actually fall.

    This time, you will read a dialogue between Ann and Bob talking about any such scene. Note that this scene is not necessarily one of the two pictures that you see.

    First, click on the upper button to see Ann's question, then click on the button below to see Bob's answer.
    <br />
    <br />
    After you read the dialogue, you will be able to select a picture by clicking on it.
    We ask you to select the picture that you think Bob is more likely to see given his answer to Ann's question.

    <br/>
    By clicking on CONTINUE you'll proceed with the next trial.

  <img src="./stimuli/img/img-screens-example.jpg" style="max-width:90%"><br/>
  Ann asks Bob a question to find out what he sees. You will see three entire scenes and we will ask you to help Ann by selecting those scenes that you think Bob is likely to see.
  <br/><br/>
  If you select only one scene and your choice is right, Bob and Ann will both get $1.<br/>
  If you select more than one scene, including the correct one, they will neither loose nor win any money.</br>
  And if you select one or several scenes but your choice is wrong (with respect to Bob's utterance), both will loose $1.<br/>

  With your selection(s) you help Ann and Bob to reach their joint goal: to make as much money as possible.
